         * backtick ` which is located right above the tab key. 
         * 
         * This allows us to embed JavaScript code into our strings instead of
         * concatenating strings and other objects which can get messy.
         * 
         * See the examples below for more :P

        /*
        The syntax used above is an alternative to adding/concatenating strings
        and variables together, and the syntax is known as a template 
        literal/string. The basic difference between template strings and 
        regular strings is that template strings use the ` character instead of
        the ' character. Then you can use the ${} syntax inside of the template
        string to represent a placeholder for a variable that will later be 
        filled in by the variable's value. There's more advanced features that
        you can make use of through template strings, but this is the basic
        idea that you'll want to know for this starter kit.
